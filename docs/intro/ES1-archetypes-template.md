title: openEHR Archetypes and Templates 
permalink: ES1-archetypes-templates.html 
summary: This section provides a basic overview of openEHR archetypes and templates 
---

The Ehrscape API consumes, retrieves and queries patient healthcare data using a standardised specification and querying format defined by the openEHR Foundation. openEHR is complex and can be
difficult for novices to understand (even those with a solid technical
background) but the Ehrscape API considerably simplifies the interface
with openEHR systems.

[openEHR](http://openehr.org) provides a way for clinicians to define and share open-source, vendor-neutral clinical information components(`archetypes` and `templates`) which can be consumed, persisted and queried by different technology stacks, as long as they adhere to the
openEHR specifications. 
Examples of archetypes used in this project are `Procedure`, `Symptom`, and `Imaging result`. 

These are managed by openEHR International using the [Clinical Knowledge Manager](http://openehr.org/ckm) tool and mirrored to [Github](https://github.com/openEHR/CKM-mirror), with a CC-BY-SA
licence.

A repository of archetypes and templates designed for UK use is
maintained Apperta Foundation at <http://clinicalmodels.org.uk> and and mirrored to a [Git
repository](https://github.com/ClinicalModelsUK/ckm).
